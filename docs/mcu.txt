8051

External memory
0xc000 - 0xcfff : 4kB of dual port memory mapped to 0xb000 - 0xb0fff on CPU
0x0002 : Read 8-bit latch from z80. Write to acknowledge
0x0000 : Read, sample byte and increment sample pointer. Write, set low sample address
0x0001 : Write, set high sample address

Sample address is high << 8 + 5, low << 5

Port 1 writes unsigned 8-bit pcm data to dac

Ext Int 0 raised when cpu writes for ffe, cleared on read
Ext Int 1 raised when latch is written, cleared on read

z80
Port 0x82 writes to mcu latch
Port 0x84 reads from second sound latch

v30
Write to port 0xc0 sets second sound latch, raises NMI on z80


TODO:
- Add 8051
- Setup program rom and support in mra
- Add Dual port memory with mailbox
- Validate that mcu is running and doing protection work, use nspiritj
- 8-bit latch from z80 to mcu
- 8-bit latch from v30 to z80
- Add sample rom loading
- Add sample addressing
- Mix DAC output with other audio
